excerpt: "With Gilbert Cette, Valérie Chouard and Rémy Lecat <br> <br> We employ the ACCL model for climate policy simulation to investigate the feasibility of achieving climate targets in the context of global economic convergence. Our findings indicate that, in a scenario with moderate economic convergence, the world does not reach these targets solely with ambitious, although realistic, energy price policies. Our estimates underscore the importance of combining global carbon taxation with the widespread deployment of green technologies to help reconcile economic convergence and climate objectives. Hence, initiatives that focus on accelerating the global energy transition and supporting its implementation in low- and middle-income countries are crucial with regard to this challenge."

**Abstract:** We employ the ACCL model for climate policy simulation to investigate the feasibility of achieving climate targets in the context of global economic convergence. Our findings indicate that, in a scenario with moderate economic convergence, the world does not reach these targets solely with ambitious, although realistic, energy price policies. Our estimates underscore the importance of combining global carbon taxation with the widespread deployment of green technologies to help reconcile economic convergence and climate objectives. Hence, initiatives that focus on accelerating the global energy transition and supporting its implementation in low- and middle-income countries are crucial with regard to this challenge.
