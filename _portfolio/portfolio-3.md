title: "Does economic convergence challenge global climate goals?"
excerpt: "With Gilbert Cette, Valérie Chouard, Rémy Lecat <br> <br> We employ the ACCL model for climate policy simulation to investigate the feasibility of achieving climate targets under global economic convergence. Our findings indicate that, in a scenario with moderate economic convergence, the world does not reach these targets with ambitious, although realistic, energy price policies solely. Our estimates underscore the importance of combining global carbon taxation with the widespread deployment of green technologies to help reconcile economic convergence and climate objectives. Hence, international initiatives, such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships, are crucial to achieve climate goals."

With Gilbert Cette, Valérie Chouard, Rémy Lecat

**Abstract:** We employ the ACCL model for climate policy simulation to investigate the feasibility of achieving climate targets under global economic convergence. Our findings indicate that, in a scenario with moderate economic convergence, the world does not reach these targets with ambitious, although realistic, energy price policies solely. Our estimates underscore the importance of combining global carbon taxation with the widespread deployment of green technologies to help reconcile economic convergence and climate objectives. Hence, international initiatives, such as the Just Energy Transition Partnerships, are crucial to achieve climate goals.
