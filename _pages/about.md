As an **Applied Environmental Economist**, my research interests encompass Policy Impact Evaluation, Climate, Energy, Health and Labour Economics.

I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and the ["Urban New Deal" Research Chair](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/pse-partnership-programme/chairs/urban-new-deal-chair/)

I am also an **Associate Researcher** at the [Centre International de Recherche sur l'Environnement et le Développement (CIRED)](https://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) and the [Centre de formation sur l’environnement et la société (CERES, Ecole Normale Supérieure - Université Paris Sciences & Lettres)](https://ceres.ens.fr/)

I conducted my **PhD thesis** titled *"Policy Impact Evaluation of Energy and Environmental Transitions"* at the [Aix-Marseille School of Economics](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/en), under the supervision of Olivier Chanel and Sarah Flèche. I developed and used advanced econometric methods to assess the socio-economic consequences of climate, energy and environmental crises and the associated policies.

I visited the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California - San Diego (UCSD), sponsored by Tarik Benmarhnia and the Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) and the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the
University of California - Santa Barbara (UCSB) sponsored by Olivier Deschenes.
