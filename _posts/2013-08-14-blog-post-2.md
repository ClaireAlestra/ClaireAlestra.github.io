SUERF Policy Brief, No. 567 

With Gilbert Cette, Valérie Chouard, Rémy Lecat

Technology may significantly contribute to reaching the 2015 Paris Agreement goals of net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and global warming below 2°C in 2100. To test that, we use the Alestra et al. (2022) Advanced Climate Change Long-term Model (ACCL), particularly adapted to quantify the consequences of energy price and technology shocks. We assess a multi-lever climate strategy combining energy efficiency gains, carbon sequestration, and a decrease in the relative price of “clean” electricity with a rise in the relative price of polluting energy sources. None of these components alone is sufficient to reach climate objectives, but our composite scenario achieves the climate goals.
